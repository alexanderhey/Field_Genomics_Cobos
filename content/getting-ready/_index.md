## What to Bring
  - **Field gear**: pants, long sleeve shirts, gloves (leather or gardening), 
  headlamp, rain gear (jacket, pants), sunscreen, hat, bug spray, personal 
  medication/toiletries, as needed
  - **Footwear**: tall rubber boots and/or snake gaiters
  - **Technology**: Laptop computer for the bioinformatic component of the 
  workshop. As we get closer to the start of the workshop, we will email 
  instructions with a list of software and files to download before arrival. 
  Please ensure you have the necessary software by visiting the 
  [Software Installation page](../programs).

## What to Prepare
  No prior experience in molecular biology or bioinformatics is necessary for 
  the workshop, but familiarity with basic concepts will be helpful. Ensure that
  all required software is installed prior to the start of the workshop.

  You will also have an opportunity to share your background in bioinformatics 
  during informal discussions. Be ready to briefly introduce yourself and share 
  the following information:
  - **Name**, position/title/career stage, organization
  - **Motivation** for taking the bioinformatics component of the workshop
  - **Research interests**
  - **Expectations** or specific goals for the bioinformatics training
  - **Rabies vaccination status**: Only participants who have had a rabies 
  vaccine (or proof of adequate rabies titers within the last 4 months) will be 
  able to work with bats. Others will work with rodents and eulipotyphlans.

## Download Reference Files and Read Data

Before starting the alignment process, make sure to download the necessary 
reference files and Nanopore reads. These files are required to follow along 
with the workflow.

### Files to Download:
- **Kipp_et_al_depletion_reference.fasta** (2.08 GB): This file contains the 
depletion reference for alignment.
- **Kipp_et_al_enrichment_reference.fasta** (14.2 MB): This file contains the 
enrichment reference for BLAST queries.
- **SRR17281099.fasta.gz** (132.2 MB): Nanopore reads in compressed FASTA format 
for alignment.

You can download all these files from a Figshare repository using the 
following link:
