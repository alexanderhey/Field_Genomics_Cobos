<div style="text-align: justify;">

<br>

To facilitate replicating a workshop with similar goals as this one, we have 
prepared a training module in the for of a manuscript in which details about the
workshop and how it was organized and executed are described. As soon as this 
manuscript is published a direct link to it will be included here. In the mean 
time, below you can fins short descriptions of things needed to replicate a similar
workshop and a link to materials that can help with that.
