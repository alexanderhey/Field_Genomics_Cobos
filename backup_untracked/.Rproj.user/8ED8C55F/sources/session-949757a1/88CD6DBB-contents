### What to Bring
- **Field clothes and gear**: 
  - Pants
  - Long sleeves
  - Leather gloves
  - Headlamp
  - Rain gear
  - Bug spray
  - Sunscreen
  - Hat
  - Personal medications/toiletries as needed

- **Footwear**:
  - Tall rubber boots and/or snake gaiters

- **Technology**:
  - Laptop computer for the bioinformatic component of the workshop. As we get closer to the start of the workshop, we will email instructions with a list of software and files to download before arrival.

- **Optional Items**:
  - A "specimen prep kit" (scissors, forceps, etc.); otherwise, we will have equipment available for specimen preparation.
  - Documentation of your rabies vaccination status to Dr. Colella. Only participants who have had a rabies vaccine (or proof of adequate rabies titers within the last 4 months) will be able to work with bats. Others will work with rodents and eulipotyphlans.

### What to Prepare
Experience in field and/or molecular biology is not required for this workshop; however, some exposure to those fields and methods will be helpful. Please prepare a **~3-5 minute "talk"** to share with the group regarding your background and research interests. Participant "talks" will be informal (e.g., no slides) and occur during downtime, allowing the group to learn more about each other's research. Consider including the following in your talk:
- **Name**, position/title/career stage, organization
- **Motivation** for taking the workshop
- **Research interests**
- **Goals** for long-term application of the information gained in the workshop
